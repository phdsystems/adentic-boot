# Stakeholder Analysis - Role Manager App

**Document Type:** Planning Artifact
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft

---

## TL;DR

**Purpose**: Identify stakeholders for the Role Manager App itself. **Key stakeholders**: Developers (users of role agents), System Admin (manages agent registry), Integration Team (integrates with parent system), Executive Sponsors (fund development). **Key insight**: Role Manager has dual stakeholder model - (1) users who consume agent outputs, (2) stakeholders who define agent

behaviors. **Communication**: Weekly demos, Slack for support, monthly reviews.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document identifies stakeholders for the Role Manager App - the system that creates and manages role-specific AI agents. Note that this is distinct from the stakeholders who USE those agents (which are defined in the parent system's stakeholder analysis).

### 1.2 Scope

**In Scope**:
- Direct users of the Role Manager App
- Teams responsible for agent configuration
- Integration teams connecting Role Manager to parent system
- Sponsors funding Role Manager development

**Out of Scope**:
- End users of individual role agents (covered in parent system docs)
- External customers or partners
