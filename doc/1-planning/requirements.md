## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies requirements for the Role Manager App, a multi-agent system that creates and manages AI agents tailored to specific stakeholder roles in software engineering workflows.

### 1.2 Scope

**In Scope**:
- Creation of 13 role-specific AI agents
- Intelligent task routing to appropriate agents
- Role-based output formatting
- Multi-agent collaboration for complex tasks
- Integration with existing LLM providers

**Out of Scope**:
- Actual software engineering workflow execution (handled by parent system)
- Custom role creation by end users (Phase 2 feature)
- Real-time agent training
- Human-in-the-loop approval workflows

### 1.3 Background

The parent "Software Engineer" system serves diverse stakeholders with different needs, communication styles, and success criteria. A one-size-fits-all approach doesn't serve stakeholders effectively. The Role Manager App solves this by creating specialized agents for each role.

**Problem Statement**:
- Developers need technical details; executives need summaries
- QA engineers want test coverage; managers want productivity metrics
- Current system provides same output regardless of stakeholder role

**Solution**:
Role-specific AI agents that understand stakeholder needs and deliver appropriately formatted outputs.
