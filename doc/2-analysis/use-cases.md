## TL;DR

**Purpose**: Define how different stakeholders interact with Role Manager App. **Primary use cases**: Execute task with specific role → Multi-agent collaboration → Discover role capabilities → View agent history. **Key actors**: Software Developer, Engineering Manager, System Administrator, Integration Developer. **Success**: All use cases implemented with <30 second response time.

## Use Case 1: Execute Task for Specific Role

**Actor**: Any Stakeholder
**Preconditions**: Role Manager running, valid role name
**Main Flow**:
1. User specifies role name and task description
2. System validates role exists
3. System routes task to appropriate agent
4. Agent executes task using LLM
5. System formats output per role preferences
6. System returns formatted output to user

**Postconditions**: Task completed, output delivered
**Alternate Flows**:
- 2a. Invalid role → Return error with available roles list
- 4a. LLM API fails → Retry with exponential backoff
- 4b. All retries fail → Return error with failure details

**Example**:

```bash
role-manager execute --role "Software Developer" --task "Review PR #123"
# Returns: Technical code review with line-by-line analysis
```

## Use Case 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration

**Actor**: Any Stakeholder
**Preconditions**: Multiple roles specified
**Main Flow**:
1. User specifies multiple roles and task
2. System creates agent instance for each role
3. Agents execute task in parallel or sequence
4. System aggregates outputs from all agents
5. System returns combined perspective

**Example**:

```bash
role-manager execute --roles "Developer,QA,Security" --task "Analyze PR #123"
# Returns: Aggregated view from all three perspectives
```

---

## Use Case 3: Discover Role Capabilities

**Actor**: New User
**Main Flow**:
1. User requests list of available roles
2. System returns all 13 roles with descriptions
3. User selects specific role for details
4. System returns capabilities, examples, output format

**Example**:

```bash
role-manager list-roles
role-manager describe-role "QA Engineer"
```

---

## Use Case 4: Configure Agent

**Actor**: System Administrator
**Main Flow**:
1. Admin modifies agent configuration file
2. System reloads agent registry
3. Agent behavior updated for future tasks

**Example**:

```yaml
# config/agents/qa-engineer.yaml
role: QA Engineer
temperature: 0.3
max_tokens: 2048
prompt_template: "You are a QA Engineer..."
```

---

## Use Case 5: View Agent History

**Actor**: Engineering Manager
**Main Flow**:
1. Manager requests agent interaction history
2. System retrieves logs filtered by role/timeframe
3. System displays task summaries and outcomes

**Example**:

```bash
role-manager history --role "Developer" --since "2025-10-01"
```
