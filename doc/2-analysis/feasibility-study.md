# Feasibility Study - Role Manager App

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Version:** 1.0

---

## TL;DR

**Verdict**: FEASIBLE. **Technical**: Java 21 + Spring Boot proven, LLM APIs mature. **Economic**: ROI positive if reduces stakeholder time by 20%+. **Operational**: Leverages existing infrastructure. **Risks**: LLM cost management, prompt quality. **Recommendation**: Proceed with 6-week MVP.

---

## Technical Feasibility

**Verdict**: ✅ FEASIBLE

**Rationale**:
- Spring Boot provides mature DI and configuration framework
- LLM provider APIs well-documented (Anthropic, OpenAI)
- Multi-agent patterns established in academic literature
- Parent system already has LLM integration

**Technical Risks**:
- LLM API rate limits → Mitigated by caching and retries
- Prompt engineering complexity → Mitigated by prompt library
- Agent context management → Solvable with session storage

## Economic Feasibility

**Verdict**: ✅ FEASIBLE (ROI Positive)

**Cost Estimate**:
- Development: 2 developers × 6 weeks × $150/hr = $36,000
- LLM API costs: $500/month estimated
- Infrastructure: $100/month (shared with parent)
- **Total first year**: ~$42,000

**Benefit Estimate**:
- 13 stakeholder types × 2 hours saved/week × $100/hr × 50 weeks = $130,000/year
- **ROI**: 310% first year

**Break-even**: Month 4

## Operational Feasibility

**Verdict**: ✅ FEASIBLE

**Integration**: Leverages parent system infrastructure
**Maintenance**: Standard Spring Boot app, familiar to team
**Support**: Existing DevOps processes apply

---

## Schedule Feasibility

**Verdict**: ✅ FEASIBLE (with MVP approach)

**Timeline**: 6 weeks for MVP (3 agents), 12 weeks for full system
**Resources**: 2 developers available
**Dependencies**: None blocking

---

## Recommendation

**PROCEED with MVP approach**:
- Week 1-6: Implement 3 core agents (Developer, Manager, QA)
- Validate concept and gather feedback
- Weeks 7-12: Implement remaining 10 agents
