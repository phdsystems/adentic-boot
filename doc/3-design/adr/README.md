# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the ADE Agent SDK project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records document important architectural decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. Each ADR captures:
- **Context:** Why was this decision needed?
- **Decision:** What was decided?
- **Alternatives:** What other options were considered?
- **Consequences:** What are the impacts (positive and negative)?

## ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed** - Under discussion
- **Accepted** - Decision approved and implemented
- **Deprecated** - No longer recommended but still in use
- **Superseded** - Replaced by another ADR (link to new ADR)
- **Rejected** - Proposal not accepted

## Creating a new ADR

1. Copy the template from the most recent ADR
2. Increment the ADR number (e.g., 0001 â†’ 0002)
3. Use descriptive kebab-case filename: `NNNN-brief-description.md`
4. Include: Context, Decision, Alternatives, Consequences
5. Update this index with the new entry
6. Commit with message: `docs(adr): add ADR-NNNN for <topic>`
