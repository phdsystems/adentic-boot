# Test Plan - Role Manager App

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Version:** 1.0

---

## TL;DR

**Scope**: All 13 role agents + core RoleManager + API endpoints. **Types**: Unit (mock LLM) + Integration (real LLM) + E2E (full workflow). **Success**: 80%+ coverage, all agents functional, <30s response time. **Timeline**: 2 weeks (Week 9-10 of project).

---

## Test Levels

### 1. Unit Tests (Week 9)

**Scope**: Individual components with mocked dependencies

**Components**:
- Each AgentRole implementation (13 tests)
- RoleManager service
- AgentRegistry
- OutputFormatter
- TaskRouter

**Coverage Target**: 85%+

**Tools**: JUnit 5, Mockito, AssertJ

---

### 2. Integration Tests (Week 9-10)

**Scope**: Components with real LLM APIs

**Test Cases**:
- Each role agent with real Anthropic API
- Multi-agent collaboration
- LLM provider failover
- Error handling and retries

**Success Criteria**:
- All agents return valid outputs
- Response time < 30 seconds
- Proper error messages on failures

---

### 3. E2E Tests (Week 10)

**Scope**: Full user workflows

**Scenarios**:
- Developer: Code review workflow
- Manager: Metrics generation workflow
- QA: Test plan generation workflow
- Multi-agent: Combined analysis workflow

---

## Test Cases

### TC-1: Execute Task for Developer Role

```
Given: Role Manager is running
When: User executes "Review PR #123" for Developer role
Then: Returns technical code review with file paths
And: Response time < 30 seconds
```

### TC-2: Multi-Agent Collaboration

```
Given: Multiple roles specified
When: Task executed for [Developer, QA, Security]
Then: Returns aggregated perspective from all roles
And: Each role's output follows its format
```

### TC-3: Invalid Role Handling

```
Given: Invalid role name "InvalidRole"
When: Task execution attempted
Then: Returns error with list of valid roles
And: No LLM API call made
```

## Acceptance Criteria

✓ All 13 role agents pass unit tests
✓ All agents produce role-appropriate outputs
✓ 95% of tasks complete in < 30 seconds
✓ Error handling works for all failure modes
✓ Multi-agent collaboration works correctly
