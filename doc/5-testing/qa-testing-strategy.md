# QA Testing Strategy - Role Manager App

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Version:** 1.0
**SDLC Phase:** 5 - Testing (QA/System Testing)

---

## TL;DR

**QA testing validates completed system** against requirements through system testing, UAT, and acceptance criteria. **Scope**: Manual testing procedures, system validation, user acceptance testing, performance testing, security testing. **Not included**: Developer automated tests (see [Implementation Test Strategy](../3-design/implementation-test-strategy.md)).

---

## Overview

This document describes the **QA and System Testing strategy** for the Role Manager App after development is complete (SDLC Phase 5). This is distinct from implementation testing (unit/integration/E2E tests written during development).

### QA Testing vs Implementation Testing

|    Aspect    |             Implementation Testing (Phase 4)              |        QA Testing (Phase 5)        |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **When**     | During development                                        | After development complete         |
| **Who**      | Developers                                                | QA team, stakeholders, end users   |
| **What**     | Automated tests (unit/integration/E2E)                    | System/UAT/acceptance/manual tests |
| **Goal**     | Fast feedback, prevent bugs                               | Validate system meets requirements |
| **Location** | Strategy: `doc/3-design/`<br>Guides: `doc/4-development/` | `doc/5-testing/` (this directory)  |

**See Also**: [Implementation Test Strategy](../3-design/implementation-test-strategy.md) for automated test details (unit/integration/E2E).

## Test Coverage Metrics

QA testing validates that automated tests provide adequate coverage:

- **[Test Coverage Report](test-coverage-report.md)** - Current coverage metrics from JaCoCo
- **Target**: 80% coverage for business logic
- **Current**: 56% overall (90% for business logic, 16% for external API wrappers)

## System Testing

**Status**: ðŸš§ To be defined

### What is System Testing?

System testing validates the **complete, integrated application** against functional and non-functional requirements.

**Test Areas**:
- âœ… Functional requirements validation
- âœ… Multi-agent workflow scenarios
- âœ… Error handling and recovery
- âœ… Configuration management
- âœ… Provider failover behavior
- âœ… Logging and monitoring

**Planned Documentation**:
- `guide/system-testing-guide.md` - System test procedures
- `system-test-plan.md` - Detailed test plan
- `system-test-results.md` - Test execution results

---

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

**Status**: ðŸš§ To be defined

### What is UAT?

UAT validates that the system meets **user/business requirements** from the stakeholder perspective.

**Test Focus**:
- âœ… User workflows match requirements
- âœ… Agent responses meet quality standards
- âœ… API usability for client applications
- âœ… Documentation completeness
- âœ… Configuration ease of use

**Planned Documentation**:
- `guide/uat-guide.md` - UAT procedures
- `uat-test-cases.md` - User acceptance test cases
- `uat-results.md` - UAT execution results

---

## Performance Testing

**Status**: ðŸš§ To be defined

### What is Performance Testing?

Performance testing validates system behavior under load and stress conditions.

**Test Scenarios**:
- âœ… Response time with multiple concurrent requests
- âœ… Multi-agent task execution performance
- âœ… Memory usage under sustained load
- âœ… Provider failover performance impact
- âœ… Large context handling

**Planned Documentation**:
- `guide/performance-testing-guide.md` - Performance test procedures
- `performance-benchmarks.md` - Performance targets and results

---

## Security Testing

**Status**: ðŸš§ To be defined

### What is Security Testing?

Security testing validates that the system is secure against common vulnerabilities.

**Test Areas**:
- âœ… API key security (not logged, not exposed)
- âœ… Input validation (prompt injection prevention)
- âœ… Error message security (no sensitive data leaked)
- âœ… Authentication/authorization (if applicable)
- âœ… Dependency vulnerability scanning

**Planned Documentation**:
- `guide/security-testing-guide.md` - Security test procedures
- `security-audit-results.md` - Security assessment results

---

## Manual Testing Procedures

**Status**: ðŸš§ To be defined

### What is Manual Testing?

Manual testing validates scenarios that are difficult or impossible to automate.

**Test Scenarios**:
- âœ… Installation and setup procedures
- âœ… Configuration file editing
- âœ… Error message clarity and usefulness
- âœ… Documentation accuracy
- âœ… CLI usability

**Planned Documentation**:
- `guide/manual-testing-guide.md` - Manual test procedures
- `manual-test-checklist.md` - Test execution checklist

## Test Execution

### Pre-Testing Checklist

Before starting QA testing:

1. âœ… All developer tests passing (unit/integration/E2E)
2. âœ… Code coverage meets targets (see [Test Coverage Report](test-coverage-report.md))
3. âœ… Build successful (`mvn clean package`)
4. âœ… Documentation up to date
5. âœ… Known issues documented

### Test Environment

QA testing should be performed in an environment that mirrors production:

- âœ… Separate from development environment
- âœ… Clean state before each test cycle
- âœ… Real LLM provider access (not mocked)
- âœ… Production-like configuration

### Test Execution Workflow

1. **Preparation**: Set up test environment, review test plan
2. **Execution**: Run test cases, document results
3. **Defect Reporting**: Log any issues found
4. **Regression Testing**: Re-test after fixes
5. **Sign-off**: Approve for release when all tests pass

## Quality Gates

Before moving to deployment (Phase 6), all QA gates must pass:

- [ ] All system tests passing
- [ ] UAT approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security audit complete (no critical vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Manual testing checklist complete
- [ ] Known issues documented and triaged
- [ ] Test coverage â‰¥ 80% for business logic
